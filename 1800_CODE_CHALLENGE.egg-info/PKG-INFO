Description: #1800 CODING CHALLENGE
        
        Many companies like to list their phone numbers using the letters printed on most
        telephones. This makes the number easier to remember for customers. An example may
        be 1-800-FLOWERS
        
        This coding challenge is to write a program that will show a user possible matches for a list
        of provided phone numbers.
        
        Your program should be a command line application that reads from files specified as
        command-line arguments or STDIN when no files are given. Each line of these files will
        contain a single phone number.
        
        For each phone number read, your program should output all possible word replacements
        from a dictionary. Your program should try to replace every digit of the provided phone
        number with a letter from a dictionary word; however, if no match can be made, a single
        digit can be left as is at that point. No two consecutive digits can remain unchanged and
        the program should skip over a number (producing no output) if a match cannot be made.
        Your program should allow the user to set a dictionary with the -d command-line option,
        but it's fine to use a reasonable default for your system. The dictionary is expected to have
        one word per line.
        
        All punctuation and whitespace should be ignored in both phone numbers and the
        dictionary file. The program should not be case sensitive, letting "a" == "A". Output should
        be capital letters and digits separated at word boundaries with a single dash (-), one
        possible word encoding per line. For example, if your program is fed the number:
        
        2255.63
        
        One possible line of output is
        
        CALL-ME
        
        According to my dictionary.
        
        The number encoding on the phone the program will use is:
        
        DIGIT CHARACTERS
        
        2 A B C
        
        3 D E F
        
        4 G H I
        
        5 J K L
        
        6 M N O
        
        7 P Q R S
        
        8 T U V
        
        9 W X Y Z
        
        
        #Installation
        First, clone 1800_CODE_CHALLENGE using git
        
        _`https://github.com/nasicseiiit/1800`_
        
        Then, cd to the 1800_CODE_CHALLENGE folder 
        
         cd 1800_CODE_CHALLENGE/
         
         sudo python setup.py install
        
        #Usage
        #Input Format
        provide the input format using CLI or STDIN
        for phone directory file you can provide the input file by STDIN or Command line
        
        `-> Passing zero command line arguments
            ... The program will prompt for the phone directory path
            ... The dictionary file will be set by the system default`
             
        `-> passing single command line argument 
            ... The argument will be the phone directory file input
            ... The dictionary file will be set by the system default
            eg : phone_numbers_data`
            
        `-> passing three command line arguments with second argument as "-d"
            ... The first argument will be the phone directory file input
            ... The third argument will be the  dictionary file input
            eg : phone_numbers_data -d dictionary`
        
        `getAlphaPhrasesForDirectoryNumbers(231) #returns  ['AD1', 'AE1', 'AF1', 'BD1', 'BE1', 'BF1', 'CD1', 'CE1', 'CF1']` 
        `getAlphaPhrasesForDirectoryNumbers(2301) #returns []` 
        `getAlphaPhrasesForDirectoryNumbers(2) #returns ['A','B','C']`
